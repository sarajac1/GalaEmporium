Magic Show
Illusionist with humor for corporate events
Welcome! here you will find one of Sweden's most booked illusionists in entertainment for corporate events. Hans offers both larger visual shows from the stage as well as entertainment mingling around among the guests up close. This makes him one of the country's most flexible illusionists and can perform his entertainment even at events where the guests are in several different rooms and where a joint stage show is not appropriate.

When you hire Hans as an illusionist, the magic is always created with laughter in focus. This allows the guests to experience both fascinating magic but also laugh together at the impossible that just became possible. Another important ingredient is interaction with the audience. This is because the guests are involved in the tricks both verbally but also physically as they often involve the guests' own items such as rings, mobile phones & money.

His magic is very well suited for an international audience. He performs his entertainment without problems in English and for those guests who have difficulty with English, magic is a good form of entertainment as many of the tricks can be enjoyed just by watching them.

If you wish, the entertainment can also be adapted to follow a certain theme or why not weave your logo or message into the magic.

Often people search for the word illusionist when they actually mean magician or sorcerer. Illusionist usually means a magician who creates larger visual illusions on stage.

An illusionist is suitable for company parties, inaugurations, jubilee, fairs, conferences and open house events.
